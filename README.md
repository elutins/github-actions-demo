## Repository Overview

Repo contains demo code to test Github Actions in various cloud environments. This project was initially motivated by Noah Gift's [github-actions-demo](https://github.com/noahgift/github-actions-demo) repo. I have expanded on his initial work by creating `conda` environments (opposed to `pip`) and assuring the Github Actions build works in Kubernetes cloud environment, in addition to AWS.
